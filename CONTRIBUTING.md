# Contributing to Limnoria

When you send pull request, please send it to the testing branch. 
It will be merged to master when it's considered to be enough stable to be 
supported.

Don't fear that you spam Limnoria by sending many pull requests. According 
to @ProgVal, it's easier for them to accept pull requests than to 
cherry-pick everything manually.
